# Substrate Traits and Generics Exploration

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a hands-on approach to learning the traits and generic system of the Substrate framework by building a blockchain from scratch. Through this project, I aimed to gain a deep understanding of how Substrate's runtime modules interact and how to effectively utilize traits and generics in blockchain development.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

- **`balances.rs`**: Manages the balance-related logic within the blockchain, including token transfers and account balances.
- **`system.rs`**: Implements core system functionalities such as block production, transaction validation, and account management.
- **`support.rs`**: Provides foundational support functions and utilities used across other modules.
- **`main.rs` (runtime)**: The main runtime file that integrates all modules and orchestrates the blockchain's behavior.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to get a comprehensive, practical understanding of the underlying architecture of the Substrate framework. By developing a blockchain from scratch, I aimed to master the application of traits and generics in Substrate, which are essential for creating efficient and scalable blockchain applications.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Substrate Mastery**: Gained hands-on experience with Substrate's traits and generics, deepening my understanding of how to build custom runtime modules.
- **Blockchain Fundamentals**: Learned the foundational principles of blockchain architecture, including account management, balance tracking, and transaction processing.
- **Runtime Development**: Developed the ability to write and integrate runtime modules that work cohesively to form a functioning blockchain.

## Conclusion

This project has significantly enhanced my knowledge of the Substrate framework and blockchain development. It has equipped me with the skills necessary to develop custom blockchains and understand the inner workings of Substrate-based networks. The hands-on experience gained from this project will serve as a solid foundation for future blockchain endeavors.
